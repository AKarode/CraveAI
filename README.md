## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Python 3.10+
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for backend)
- OpenAI API key
- PineconeDB API key

### Backend Setup

**Option 1: Using Docker (recommended)**
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up
```

**Option 2: Manual Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:8000

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

## üìñ Usage

### Uploading a Menu
1. Log in to your restaurant account
2. Navigate to the "Menu Management" section
3. Click "Upload Menu" and select a PDF or image file
4. The system will automatically extract menu items
5. Review and edit extracted items if needed, then save

### User Experience
1. Browse restaurant listings
2. Select a restaurant to view its menu
3. Use the AI assistant to get personalized recommendations
4. Select dishes and provide feedback on your experience

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Menu Extraction**: When a restaurant uploads a menu, our OCR service extracts text from the document. For non-English menus, translation services convert the text to English.

2. **Vector Database**: Extracted menu items are processed and stored in PineconeDB, creating embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of each dish.

3. **Recommendation Engine**: When users interact with the system, their preferences and queries are matched against the menu embeddings to provide personalized recommendations.

4. **Feedback Loop**: User selections and satisfaction ratings are collected to continuously improve the recommendation algorithm.

## üìö API Documentation

The backend API documentation is available at http://localhost:8000/docs when the backend is running.

Key endpoints include:
- `/upload-menu`: Upload and process restaurant menus
- `/recommendations`: Get personalized dish recommendations
- `/feedback`: Submit user feedback on recommendations
