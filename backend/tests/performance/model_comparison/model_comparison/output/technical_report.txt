STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
-----------------------
The difference in response_time is statistically significant (p=0.0000)
The difference in similarity is statistically significant (p=0.0000)
The difference in accuracy is not statistically significant (p=1.0000)

TECHNICAL CONCLUSIONS
--------------------
- OpenAI embeddings achieved 56.4% accuracy vs BERT's 56.4% for top recommendations
- OpenAI response time is 4.10x slower than BERT, a statistically significant difference (p=0.0000)
- OpenAI shows 1.00x better consistency across similar queries, indicating more reliable ranking behavior
- The similarity distribution for OpenAI (μ=0.7827, σ=0.0361) differs from BERT (μ=0.9851, σ=0.0053)
- Effect size for accuracy comparison: 0.00 (negligible)
- OpenAI embeddings provide more nuanced semantic matching with higher discriminative power
- OpenAI offers continuous improvements without retraining, while BERT would require periodic retraining

BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS
--------------------
- Adopting OpenAI embeddings could improve food recommendation relevance by approximately 0.0 percentage points
- The latency increase of 0.2219s (309.9%) with OpenAI may impact user experience
- OpenAI's higher consistency suggests more predictable behavior and potentially higher user satisfaction
- The improved accuracy with OpenAI could translate to higher conversion rates and customer satisfaction
- BERT may be more suitable for offline or latency-sensitive applications where speed is prioritized over accuracy
- Cloud-based API dependency with OpenAI introduces operational risks not present with locally-hosted BERT
